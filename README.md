An experiment to create presentations through version controlled codebase 
instead of using office software (libre or otherwise)

## Other stuff

I currently live in Dubai and generally found either (and not in any order)
- programming
- tweeting
- playing DotA2; listening to classical rock guitar solos; reading about 
psychology, shower-thoughts, what-ifs, statistical modeling, high available 
infrastructure, systems design, mega-engineering and skynet.
