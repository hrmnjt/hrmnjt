Hi! I'm Harman (aka. hrmnjt) on wild-wild internet.

I work at ~~[@MuSigmaInc](https://twitter.com/MuSigmaInc)~~
~~[@MajidAlFuttaim](https://www.majidalfuttaim.com/)~~ 
[Department of Health](https://www.doh.gov.ae/en/) on data analytics,
~~backend applications~~, recommendation engines, ~~system programming~~,
analytical and transactional data engineering, entity resolution, and dataops.

When I'm not working, I'm generally spending time with my family, coding away
on a random idea that came to my mind right now, listening to Rock Guitar Solo,
or nerding out with blogs or books.
