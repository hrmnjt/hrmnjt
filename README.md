# `whoami`

I work at ~~[@MuSigmaInc](https://twitter.com/MuSigmaInc)~~ [@MajidAlFuttaim](https://twitter.com/MajidAlFuttaim) on ~~data analytics~~, ~~backend applications~~, ~~recommendation engines~~, system programming, analytical and transactional database systems, yaml engineering and dataops. 

I currently live in Dubai and generally found either (and not in any order)
- programming
- tweeting or reading the tweets
- playing DoTA2
- listening to classical rock guitar solos or reading about psychology, shower-thoughts, what-ifs, statistical modeling, 
infrastructure, systems design and skynet
